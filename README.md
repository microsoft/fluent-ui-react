Stardust is a set of specifications and tools for building UI libraries. It is based on a fork of [Semantic UI React (SUIR)][200].

## How Can I Help?

### [Voice Your Opinion][101]

Help shape this library by weighing in on our [RFC (request for comments)][101] issues. 

### [Contribute][3]

Our [CONTRIBUTING.md][3] is a step-by-step setup and development guide.

### [Good First Issue][103]

Issues labeled [`good first issue`][103] are a great way to ease into development on this project. 

### [New Components][102]

There is an issue for every new component labeled [`new component`][102].  Just comment on the issue you'd like to take.

### [Help Wanted Label][100]

Any other issue labeled [`help wanted`][100] is also ready for a PR.

## Why?

There are a number of packages that a UI library needs to create great UI components. Take a look at SUIR's [`/src/lib`][201] as an example. This core library enables the SUIR features we love today such as shorthand props, event stack handling, auto controlled state, controlling the rendered component, and more.

Other libraries in the wild have some of these features and some of their own. It is our desire that the community share the best UI component practices in a core library to the greater benefit of the web.

A shared library means more great ideas and more engineering support for features and bug fixes. More importantly, it means more consistency in UI components on the web. We're really excited to see just how far we can take this aspect of collaboration.

## Scope

You can think of Stardust as the internals of a good component library. This encompasses everything that one UI library may need, starting from the common UI component available on the web, custom theming, accessibility and rtl. Currently there is an React implementation of it, available here: [stardust-ui/react](https://github.com/stardust-ui/react).

## Contributing Organizations

Currently, these teams are actively participating in Stardust's specifications and development:

- [Semantic UI React][200]
- [Office UI Fabric][300]
- [Teams (Microsoft)][301]

If you own or are building a UI component library, we'd love to have your input. [Post an issue][2] introducing yourself and your team and join us today.

You can actively contribute to Stardust by referring to the [Contributing][3] documentation.

## Usage examples

You can find Stardust usage examples by accessing the [doc site][5]

## Semantic UI React v2

See the [MANIFESTO.md][1] for details. SUIR v2 will be built on the specifications and tools from Stardust.
