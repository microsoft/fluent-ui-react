    Stardust uses some unique component patterns. These patterns are the result of a great amount
    thought, debate, and vetting. This page gives you the assumptions and reasoning we've used that
    drives our design decisions.

## TODO

Walk through a component file and explain WHY each of the design patterns in it exist.

## First Principles

### Useful out of the box

Components should be immediately useful out of the box.

#### Auto controlled state

Components should not require "wiring" to work.
Example, a Dropdown should open when clicked without requiring the dev to wire the `open` prop to an `onOpen` handler and manage the state.

Components should give up control to the dev if the dev passes props.
Example, a Dropdown should never change the `open` state if a dev has explicitly an `open` value.

Components should resume automatic control of state if the dev removes props.
Example, a Dropdown should automatically open and close when appropriate if the dev removes the `open`.

### Component Anatomies

A component anatomy is simply the name of component and all of its parts.
Standardized component anatomies are at the core of the Stardust's approach to components.
Component anatomies provide a consistent and predictable interface that allows us to create reusable and generic abstractions.

#### Slots

There is one slot for each part in a component's anatomy.
Example, an Dialog contains a `header` part, a `content` part, and a `footer` part (among others).
There is then one prop for each of these slots in the Dialog's API.

#### State, style, accessibility

Props containing state information

### Automatic Accessibility

#### Role and Aria

When it is possible to always "do the right thing", `role` and `aria` props should be added and removed automatically.
Example, a Checkbox should automatically add and remove `aria-checked` when the dev adds or removes the `checked` prop.

#### Keyboard Navigation

Components should be keyboard navigable by default.
Example,

### Framework Agnostic

Frameworks change often.
The concept and functional parts of components will live for a very long time.

Example, the dropdown component has lived through many evolutions of frameworks with little change.
The anatomy, state, and accessibility aspects

The concept and use of dropdown will live on.

We shouldn't
Although this doc site is about React components, the internals of these components are built using framework agnostic parts.

### Design Agnostic

UI designs change very often.
When a component design changes it almost never requires a functional change to the component.
Yet, with traditional component architectures often times design changes are not possible to implement and require rewriting the component.

Stardust components do not dictate any theme or style.
Any component can be styled in anyway allowing full reuse of the functional accessibility

### Extend, override, or replace anything at any time

**Why?**

**How?**
Stardust components aim to allow you to extend, override, or replace the state, styling, and accessibility features of any component at any time.
Our components attempt to "do the right thing" by default, but do not lock you in to any decision.

This is usually achieved by allowing the dev to pass state, style, and accessibility information through React context or component props.

### Function Components & Class Components

We believe in breaking down utilities to support

## Conformance

All Stardust components are tested against conformance criteria. This ensures that components behave in a consistent and predictable way.

Philosophy
The project should help contributors fall into the pit of success by catching common mistakes

### `throwError(`Components should export a class or function, got: \${componentType}.`)`

Problems

- Sometimes contributors forget to export their component.
- Sometimes contributors export their component incorrectly.

Solutions

throwError(
[
'Component is not a named function. This should help identify it:\n\n',
`${ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(<Component />)}`,
].join(''),
)
