Stardust UI components can have "slots" which accept shothand props. For example, `Button` component has an `icon` slot which value defines the icon that will be rendered.

```jsx
<Button icon="camera" />
```

There are several forms of shorthand values that can be provided, but all of them share one common thing - each is eventually evaluated to React Element. Thus, you can think of shorthand values as a recipe to customize rendered React Element.

## Object as value

Each component's slot has associated default element type. For example, by default there is
`<Icon />` element rendered for `Button`'s `icon` slot. It is possible to customize props of this default element by providing props object as shorthand value:

```jsx
// ðŸ’¡ 'name' and 'size' will be used as <Icon /> element's props
<Button icon={{ name: 'camera', size: 'small' }} />
```

## Primitive as value

There is even shorter way to define default element's props - by using a primitive value. In that case provided shorthand value will be taken as a value for "default prop" of this element.

This could be much easier seen with an example. Here, again, we have a `Button`
element with its icon being defined with shorthand - where provided `string` value
will be used as icon's `name`:

```jsx
<>
  <Button icon="camera" />
  {/* ðŸ’¡ has identical effect to the previous one */}
  <Button icon={{ name: 'camera' }} />
</>
```

This works because `name` is the default prop of shorthand's `<Icon />` element. You can also pass React Elements to slots:

```jsx
<>
  <Popup content={<em>Awesome Popup!</em>} />
  {/* ðŸ’¡ has identical effect to the previous one */}
  <Popup content={{ content: <em>Awesome Popup!</em> }} />
</>
```

### Disable slot's rendering

It is also possible to pass falsy values (`false`, `null` or
`undefined`) to shorthand prop - iin that case there will be nothing rendered for the component's slot.

```jsx
<Dropdown toggleIndicator={null} />
```

## Function as value

Providing function as a shorthand value is the most involving but, at the same time, the most
powerful option for customizing component's slot. The only requirements for this function are:

- it should finish syncronously
- it should return React Element as a result

Thus, in its simplest form, it could be used the following way:

```jsx
<Button icon={() => <Icon name="chess rook" />} />
```

However, if it will be just about that, this function form wouldn't introduce any additional value. So, lets take a look on the scenarios where it is really helpful.

### 'Render' callback argument

When function is provided as a shorthand value, there is a `render` callback provided
as its argument. This `render` argument is a function that 'knows' how to render all
the previously considered shorthand types - i.e. primitive values, objects, React Elements.

Here is an example that represents this:

```jsx
<>
  {/* All three have the same effect: */}
  <Button icon="chess rook" />
  {/* render() transforms string to <Icon /> element */}
  <Button icon={render => render('chess rook')} />
  {/* render() transforms object to <Icon /> element */}
  <Button icon={render => render({ name: 'chess rook' })} />
</>
```

### Handle Async data loading scenarios

This 'render callback' arg makes it possible for the client to tackle scenarios where slot's data may be fetched asynchronously.

Consider the following scenario: suppose we need to render `Button`'s icon, but the
problem is that icon's name is fetched from some remote source. Thus, we cannot do it as
simply as that, as icon's name is not known at the moment `Button` is rendered:

```jsx
<Button icon={{ name: /* unknown yet */ undefined }} />
```

It is quite common case that there is some component that is responsible for data fetching
abstraction - and it is possible to 'tell' this component what should be rendered while data
is loading, as well as what should be rendered when data is fetched.

```jsx
<AsyncData
  getData={fetch('https://some/url')}
  onLoading={<div>Loading..</div>} // renders when data is loading
  onLoaded={data => <div>Loaded Data: {data}</div>} // renders once data is fetched
/>
```

Lets suppose that we want to render `loading` icon before data is fetched, and switch it with
the icon which `name` will be provided by fetched `data` object. Also, note
that we have `render` arg that knows _how_ to render `Button`'s icons.

Putting it all together, we will address our async data fetch case:

```jsx
<Button
  icon={render => (
    <AsyncData
      getData={fetch('https://some/url')}
      onLoading={<Icon name="loading" />}
      /* using 'render' arg here to render icon from loaded na */
      onLoaded={data => render({ name: data.iconName })}
    />
  )}
/>
```

Note that this example can be further simplified, as `render` can be used to render
'loading' icon as well:

```jsx
<Button
  icon={render => (
    <AsyncData
      getData={fetch('https://some/url')}
      /* using 'render' arg here to render loading icon as well */
      onLoading={render('loading')}
      onLoaded={data => render({ name: data.iconName })}
    />
  )}
/>
```

### Customizing rendered tree

There is another use case that `render` callback arg is very useful for - this is the
case where custom element's tree should be rendered for the slot, but, at the same time, all
the evaluated styles and accessibility behaviors should be preserved for rendered custom
element.

As you might recall, there is a problem that might happen when React Element is provided
directly as shorthand value - in that case Stardust props are not propagated to rendered
element, which may result in broken styles and accessibility. In order to avoid that the
following strategy should be considered:

```jsx
<Button
  icon={render =>
    render(
      /* what to render */
      { name: 'chess rook' },

      /* how to render */
      (ComponentType, props) => (
        <div class="my-icon-container">
          <i class="my-chess-rook-icon" {...props.accessibility.root} />
        </div>
      ),
    )
  }
/>
```

Here we are passing a recipe of how evaluated `ComponentType` (`Icon` in our
case, which is ignored by the rendered tree) and `props` should be passed to custom
elements tree. Note that `props` object, amongst others, contains all the necessary
evaluated accessibility attributes that should be applied to rendered element.
