    <Header as="h3" content="Types" />
    <p>
      Types are versions of an element that modify the element's standard appearance. Types cannot
      be used simultaneously on the same element. For example, "cats" and "dogs" are types of
      animals, but are mutually exclusive.
    </p>
    <Header as="h3" content="State" />
    <p>
      States are modifications to an element that help indicate a change in{' '}
      <a
        href="http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/affordance/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener nofollow"
      >
        [affordance]
      </a>. Common states include loading, disabled, and active.
    </p>
    <Header as="h3" content="Content" />
    <p>
      Content are parts which only have meaning in the context of a component. Content use names
      which describe the type of expected content like header, description, menu, or item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content inside a collection or view often includes stubbed versions of other components. For
      example cards let you use image content, which can be extended by using different variations.
    </p>
    <Header as="h3" content="Variations" />
    <p>Variations modify qualities of an element like size or color.</p>
    <p>Variations are mutually inclusive, and can be used together to modify an element.</p>
    <Header as="h2" content="API Design" />
    <Header as="h3" content="Top Level API" />
    <Header as="h4" content="Components" />
    <p>
      A component is a general term used to refer to any user interface element packaged for
      distribution. (Not to be confused with React’s Component)
    </p>
    <Header as="h4" content="Shorthand/ Children definition" />
    <p>
      Most of the components support two ways of definition: <code>shorthand</code> and{' '}
      <code>children</code>. With the shorthand definition we are adding some props to the component
      in order to define it’s content, in opposite to the children where we are adding the content
      inside the component, or using some subcomponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: when defining the text displayed in the Button component, we can pass the content
      prop or we can define the text inside the component:
    </p>
    <CodeSnippet
      label="index.jsx"
      value={['<Button content="Click me!" />', '<Button>Click me!</Button>'].join('\n')}
    />

    <Header as="h4" content="Subcomponents" />
    <p>
      Some of the components have subcomponents defined for passing JSX elements for special parts
      of the component. For example the Menu components can contain multiple items inside, that can
      be defined using the Item subcomponent in the following manner:
    </p>
    <CodeSnippet
      label="index.jsx"
      value={[
        '<Menu>',
        '  <Menu.Item active={activeItem === "a"} onClick={this.handleItemClick("a")}>',
        '    Editorials',
        '  </Menu.Item>',
        '  <Menu.Item active={activeItem === "b"} onClick={this.handleItemClick("b")}>',
        '    Reviews',
        '  </Menu.Item>',
        '  <Menu.Item active={activeItem === "c"} onClick={this.handleItemClick("c")}>',
        '    Upcoming Events',
        '  </Menu.Item>',
        '</Menu>',
      ].join('\n')}
    />

    <Header as="h3" content="Props API" />
    <Header as="h4" content="Enum" />
    <p>
      We use enum for properties when multiple values are mutually exclusive. We should use the same
      enums defining the same props across all components for consistency.
    </p>
    <Header as="h4" content="Boolean" />
    <p>
      We use boolean for properties when multiple values are mutually inclusive and don’t need any
      description. This way we are only implying that that property is applied to the component.
    </p>
