Stardust UI has `Flex` and `Grid` components to handle layout aspects, they represent corresponding [CSS layout modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction). `Flex` is made for one dimensional layouts and `Grid` is made for two dimensional layouts.

## `Flex`

`Flex` is for either columns _or_ rows. This means that if you are laying out items in one direction (for example buttons inside a header), then you should use `Flex`.

`Flex` component addresses all common [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) layout scenarios and defines additional props to address most common [Flexbox usage scenarios](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Typical_Use_Cases_of_Flexbox) (e.g. `push` prop). `Flex.Item` component can be used to tweak flex styles of individual child item and will not produce additional DOM nodes.

You can learn more in [Flex component docs](/components/flex).

## `Grid`

`Grid` is for lining things up in columns _and_ rows, it implements [Grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) module.

More examples are available in [Grid component docs](/components/grid).
