## Changing a component's element type

Stardust UI allows you to customize the element a component renders to via the `as` prop. For example, while a `Button` component would normally render as a `button` element, by using as `as` you could change that to an `a` instead:

```jsx
// renders as: <a href="#">Hello World</a>
<Button as="a" href="#">
  Hello World
</Button>
```

## Unhandled props & HTML attributes

Stardust components will pass any props that they don't explicity handle down to their underlying element. In practice, this means that Stardust components support all HTML attributes.

```jsx
// `onLoad` and `onError` are not handled directly by Image, so they are
// passed through to the underlying img element.
<Image
  src="//placehold.it/300"
  onLoad={() => alert("Loaded")}
  onError={() => alert("Error")}
/>
```

Combine this with the `as` prop, and you get component composition without any added layers. This can be essential for working with third-party libraries.

```jsx
import {Button} from "@stardust-ui-react"
import {Link} from "react-router-dom"

// Button does not handle the `to` prop, so it gets through to the underlying
// Link component.
export default (
  <Button as={Link} to="/home">
    To homepage
  </Button>
)
```
