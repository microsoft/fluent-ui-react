**Step 1:** Using your favorite package manager, add [@stardust-ui/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stardust-ui/react) to your project:

```bash
# npm
npm install --save @stardust-ui/react

# yarn
yarn add @stardust-ui/react
```

**Step 2:** Import [Provider](/components/provider) from @stardust-ui/react and place it at the root of your application and pass it your preferred theme using its `theme` prop:

```jsx{3,6-8}
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import {Provider, themes} from "@stardust-ui/react"

const App = () => (
  <Provider theme={themes.teams}>
    {/* The rest of your application goes here. */}
  </Provider>
)

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"))
```

**Step 3**: Build something cool! You're now ready to start using Stardust components in your application. Below is an example that renders a simple [Header](/components/header) with some content.

```jsx{2,6}
import React from "react"
import {Header} from "@stardust-ui/react"

const App = () => (
  <Provider theme={themes.teams}>
    <Header>Hello World</Header>
  </Provider>
)
```

Stardust provides many primitive building-blocks, such as [Flex](/components/flex), [Text](/components/text), and more. These small components are the foundation of the library, and while they are useful on their own, they become more interesting when combined to build larger, more complicated components.

While you will find that most high-level components meet your requirements exactly, sometimes you may need to customize individual parts within them. Learn how in the next section!
