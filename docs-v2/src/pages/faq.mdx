## Does Stardust support mobile platforms?

Not yet! We're still in pre-release, and are therefore focusing exclusively on desktop platforms. In the future, we do plan to support handheld devices like tablets and phones.

## How do I write reusable mixins?

Mixins are are utilities that allow you to generate styles, perhaps based on some input. These are probably familiar to you if you're coming from a language like SASS or LESS.

Styles in Stardust are written in JavaScript using [CSS in JS](https://github.com/fela/fela), where the styles themselves are described by plain objects. Therefore, writing a mixin is as simple as writing a JavaScript function.

```js
function scale(ratio) {
  return {
    transform: `scale(${ratio})`
  }
}
```

## I'm reusing an existing theme. How do I change just a few things?

Themes, just like styles, are described by plain JavaScript objects, so modifying a value in the theme is the same as modifying an object. As an example, here's how you would change the fonts loaded by the Teams theme:

```jsx
import {themes} from "@stardust-ui/react"

// Clone the theme so that anyone using the original theme
// doesn't see your changes (skip this if you do want that).
const MyTheme = {...themes.teams}

// Change the desired theme value. In this example, we're
// changing the font face to "Segoe UI".
MyTheme.fontFaces = [
  {
    name: 'Segoe UI',
    paths: ['https://...'],
    style: { fontWeight: 600 },
  },
]

// Use your newly-customized theme.
<Provider theme={MyTheme}>
  {/* ... */}
</Provider>
```

## How do I know when an image has finished loading?

Any props that don't have special behavior from Stardust are passed through to the underlying element (in Stardust, these are called "unhandled props"). So, using [Image](/components/image) as an example, you can provide **onLoad** and **onError** props just like you would with a regular **img** element, and Stardust will pass these through to the underlying img element.

```jsx
import {Image} from "@stardust-ui/react"

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image
      src="//placehold.it/300"
      onLoad={() => console.log("loaded")}
      onError={() => console.log("error")}
    />
  )
}
```
